# Module 06 — Opportunities (Pipelines)

## Why it matters
Opportunities convert conversation into a trackable sales process: stages, owners, values, and “won/lost” outcomes that power reporting and follow-up automations.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Create and edit pipelines and stages with clear rules.
- Manage opportunity cards (create, move, assign, update value/status).
- Automate pipeline movement using workflows.
- Use opportunities for two-track operations (Sales + Fulfillment).

## Vocabulary
- **Pipeline**: a board representing a process (sales or fulfillment)
- **Stage**: column in a pipeline (must be action-based)
- **Opportunity**: a deal object tied to a contact
- **Card value**: expected revenue (not necessarily cash collected)
- **Won/Lost**: closing outcomes

## Recommended pipeline patterns (for capstone)
### Sales - Advertisers
Stages (example):
1) New Lead
2) Contacted
3) Interested
4) Proposal Sent
5) Payment Link Sent
6) Won (Ad Sold)
7) Lost

### Fulfillment - Sign Orders
Stages (example):
1) New Order
2) Design Approved
3) Sent to Vendor
4) Ready for Pickup / Scheduled Dropoff
5) Installed / Completed
6) Closed

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) Opportunities represent: **deals tied to contacts** ✅  
2) True/False: Opportunity value always equals cash collected. **False** ✅  
3) A pipeline stage should be: **action-based with clear move rules** ✅  
4) Won/Lost stages: **exist by default and represent outcomes** ✅  
5) Two pipelines can be used for: **sales tracking and fulfillment tracking** ✅  
6) If a lead pays, you should move to: **Won** ✅  
7) If fulfillment is waiting on vendor, stage should reflect: **Sent to Vendor / waiting** ✅  
8) Pipelines can be updated by: **workflows** ✅  
9) If stages are duplicated, you might see: **naming uniqueness errors** ✅  
10) Opportunities help reporting by: **tracking deal progress and values** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
1) Create pipeline `Sales - Advertisers`
2) Create pipeline `Fulfillment - Sign Orders`
3) Create 2 test opportunities and move them through 3 stages.
Evidence:
- screenshots of both pipelines with stage names visible
- screenshot of an opportunity card showing value + assigned owner
Rubric: Pass if pipelines exist and stages match spec.

## Relatable metaphor — “Factory Assembly Line”
Opportunities are the assembly line for deals. Each stage is a workstation; if parts pile up at one station, the whole line slows.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **Lead qualifies mid-call**
  - Decision: create opportunity immediately or later? → Create immediately, assign owner, and set stage to reflect verbal intent.
  - Decision: missing budget info? → Add a follow-up task and tag `status:needs-info` before moving stages.
- **Pipeline clog**
  - Decision: many cards stuck in “Proposal Sent”? → Trigger follow-up workflow or schedule callbacks; consider moving stale cards to Lost with reasons.
  - Decision: lost reasons not captured? → Add required field or dropdown before stage change is allowed.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. What data must be captured before moving to “Qualified”? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Contact owner, budget/need notes, and next action.</details>
2. How do you avoid stale opportunities? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Use tasks/reminders and enforce lost reasons for aging cards.</details>
3. Which module links most directly to pipeline value? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Payments/Transactions for actual collected revenue.</details>
4. Why align pipeline names to naming conventions? <details><summary>Answer</summary>For consistent reporting and automation triggers.</details>
5. What should happen after marking Lost? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Apply a lost reason, tag for reactivation sequence, and update reporting.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Unclog a pipeline**
  - Deliverable: Clean pipeline with stage WIP limits and updated lost reasons.
  - Evidence: Before/after screenshots of the board, plus one opportunity record showing tasks and notes.
  - Rubric: Pass if stages are defined, cards are redistributed or closed appropriately, and evidence shows notes/tasks per SOP.
