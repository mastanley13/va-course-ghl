# Module 04 — Calendars (Sub-Account)

## Why it matters
Calendars connect marketing to revenue: leads book appointments, confirmations go out, no-shows are reduced, and ops schedules (vendor pickup/delivery) are coordinated.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Create a Personal Booking calendar and share/embed it.
- Connect a user’s external calendar (Google/Outlook/iCloud) where required.
- Configure availability, buffers, duration, and reminders.
- Use calendars in workflows and sites.

## Key platform note (Dec 2025)
HighLevel requires a HighLevel Booking Calendar as the foundation for scheduling rules even if Google Calendar is used.

## Vocabulary
- **Calendar type**: personal booking vs other types
- **Availability**: allowed booking windows
- **Buffer**: padding before/after appointments
- **Conflict calendar**: blocks times based on another calendar
- **Reminders**: SMS/email reminders tied to appointment events
- **Embed code**: place calendar on a website/funnel page

## Production SOP — Minimal calendar configuration
1) Calendar name is explicit (who/what)
2) Duration matches service type
3) Buffers set (protect ops)
4) Confirmation + reminder sequence exists
5) Calendar link tested end-to-end

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) A booking calendar is used to: **let contacts schedule appointments** ✅  
2) True/False: Google calendar alone is sufficient without a HighLevel booking calendar. **False** ✅  
3) What prevents back-to-back meetings? **Buffers** ✅  
4) A conflict calendar is used to: **block availability when another calendar has events** ✅  
5) Where do you embed a calendar for leads to book? **Sites/Funnels page via Calendar element or embed** ✅  
6) Reminders help reduce: **no-shows** ✅  
7) If bookings double-book, what do you check first? **availability/conflict calendar settings** ✅  
8) Calendar links should be tested in: **incognito / logged-out view** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
- Create a calendar named: `Vendor - Pickup Scheduling`
- Provide:
  - booking link
  - screenshot of availability settings
  - screenshot of reminder configuration
Rubric: Pass if calendar exists, settings match instructions, and link works.

## Relatable metaphor — “Restaurant Reservation Book”
Calendars are the reservation book and seating chart for the business. If the book is sloppy, guests double-book or wait forever; if it’s clean, service runs smooth and the kitchen (teams) stay in sync.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **New service launch**
  - Decision: one or multiple calendars? → Use separate calendars for different offer types or teams to avoid availability collisions.
  - Decision: who owns bookings? → Assign calendar ownership and pipeline stage mapping before sharing links.
- **Troubleshooting no-shows**
  - Decision: Are reminders firing? → Check notification settings; if off, enable and test.
  - Decision: Timezones wrong? → Verify account timezone, then calendar-specific overrides.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. When would you split calendars by team? <details><summary>Answer</summary>When sales vs service need separate availability and routing.</details>
2. What protects against back-to-back burnout? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Buffers configured between appointments.</details>
3. How do you ensure a booking updates sales tracking? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Map the calendar to an Opportunities pipeline/stage.</details>
4. Which setting prevents last-minute abuse? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Minimum notice time before scheduling.</details>
5. What’s the first place to check if times look off by a day? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Sub-account timezone and then the calendar-specific timezone override.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Build + test a calendar**
  - Deliverable: New calendar configured with buffers, min notice, and pipeline mapping.
  - Evidence: Screenshot of settings, plus a test booking record and resulting pipeline stage update.
  - Rubric: Pass if booking honors buffer/min notice, lands in the correct pipeline stage, and reminders are demonstrated or documented.
