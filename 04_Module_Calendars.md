# Module 04 — Calendars (Sub-Account)

## Why it matters
Calendars connect marketing to revenue: leads book appointments, confirmations go out, no-shows are reduced, and ops schedules (vendor pickup/delivery) are coordinated.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Create a Personal Booking calendar and share/embed it.
- Connect a user’s external calendar (Google/Outlook/iCloud) where required.
- Configure availability, buffers, duration, and reminders.
- Use calendars in workflows and sites.

## Key platform note (Dec 2025)
HighLevel requires a HighLevel Booking Calendar as the foundation for scheduling rules even if Google Calendar is used.

## Vocabulary
- **Calendar type**: personal booking vs other types
- **Availability**: allowed booking windows
- **Buffer**: padding before/after appointments
- **Conflict calendar**: blocks times based on another calendar
- **Reminders**: SMS/email reminders tied to appointment events
- **Embed code**: place calendar on a website/funnel page

## Production SOP — Minimal calendar configuration
1) Calendar name is explicit (who/what)
2) Duration matches service type
3) Buffers set (protect ops)
4) Confirmation + reminder sequence exists
5) Calendar link tested end-to-end

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) A booking calendar is used to: **let contacts schedule appointments** ✅  
2) True/False: Google calendar alone is sufficient without a HighLevel booking calendar. **False** ✅  
3) What prevents back-to-back meetings? **Buffers** ✅  
4) A conflict calendar is used to: **block availability when another calendar has events** ✅  
5) Where do you embed a calendar for leads to book? **Sites/Funnels page via Calendar element or embed** ✅  
6) Reminders help reduce: **no-shows** ✅  
7) If bookings double-book, what do you check first? **availability/conflict calendar settings** ✅  
8) Calendar links should be tested in: **incognito / logged-out view** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
- Create a calendar named: `Vendor - Pickup Scheduling`
- Provide:
  - booking link
  - screenshot of availability settings
  - screenshot of reminder configuration
Rubric: Pass if calendar exists, settings match instructions, and link works.
