# Module 12 — Memberships & Communities (Optional/Advanced)

## Why it matters
Memberships/Communities are optional for the capstone, but they are common in client builds. They matter when the advertiser offer includes training, onboarding, or a partner portal.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Create a course structure (categories + lessons).
- Create offers for access (free/paid).
- Invite members and troubleshoot login access.
- Configure a community group and attach learning content.

## Vocabulary
- **Course**: structured content
- **Lesson**: unit inside a course
- **Offer**: access + pricing wrapper for a course
- **Member**: user with login access
- **Community group**: discussion + learning space

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
Create:
- Course: `Partner Onboarding - Advertisers`

Evidence: screenshots of course structure and an offer setup screen.

## Relatable metaphor — “Private Clubhouse”
Memberships and Communities are the clubhouse: members get keys, see curated rooms, and follow house rules to keep the vibe strong.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **Onboarding new members**
  - Decision: auto-enroll or manual? → Auto-enroll after payment; manual for scholarship/partner access.
  - Decision: welcome via email or SMS? → Use email for links and policy, SMS only if consented for reminders.
- **Moderating community posts**
  - Decision: delete or coach? → Hide harmful content, but coach members on formatting and tagging to keep engagement organized.
  - Decision: who can post announcements? → Limit to moderators/admins to avoid noise.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. When do you grant access to a course? <details><summary>Answer</summary>After payment/qualification, via offer access settings.</details>
2. How do you reduce churn inside the community? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Post weekly prompts, pin guidelines, and respond quickly to new member posts.</details>

4. What tag could you add to community-only members? <details><summary>Answer</summary>`seg:community-only` to separate from paying students.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Member onboarding path**
  - Deliverable: Course + offer + welcome automation that shares login and community link.
  - Evidence: Screenshots of course structure, offer access, community post, and a test member login preview.
  - Rubric: Pass if access works, welcome path is documented, and community permissions reflect the intended roles.
