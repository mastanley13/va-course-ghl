# Module 13 — Media Storage (Assets)

## Why it matters
Media Storage is the asset source for Sites, Email, Social, and Products. Clean asset management prevents broken branding and duplicated clutter.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Create a folder structure for a new client build.
- Upload and organize media with consistent naming.
- Use bulk actions (move/delete) safely.
- Restore from trash and understand retention.
- Edit an image using the built-in editor (basic crop/adjustments).

## Vocabulary
- **Media library**: asset storage
- **Folder hierarchy**: organization structure
- **Trash**: deleted item holding area (time-limited)
- **Preview/insert**: selecting assets inside builders
- **Duplicate control**: avoiding repeated uploads
