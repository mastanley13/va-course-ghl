# Module 13 — Media Storage (Assets)

## Why it matters
Media Storage is the asset source for Sites, Email, Social, and Products. Clean asset management prevents broken branding and duplicated clutter.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Create a folder structure for a new client build.
- Upload and organize media with consistent naming.
- Use bulk actions (move/delete) safely.
- Restore from trash and understand retention.
- Edit an image using the built-in editor (basic crop/adjustments).

## Vocabulary
- **Media library**: asset storage
- **Folder hierarchy**: organization structure
- **Trash**: deleted item holding area (time-limited)
- **Preview/insert**: selecting assets inside builders
- **Duplicate control**: avoiding repeated uploads

## Course sections and pages

- Page 4: Bulk actions and safe deletion

### Section C — QA + troubleshooting
- Page 5: File size/format issues (varies by module)
- Page 6: Google Drive import limitations (owned vs shared assets)

### Section D — Quiz
- Page 7: Quiz (8 questions)

### Section E — Lab
- Page 8: Build brand-kit folder tree and upload sample assets

## Recommended folder structure
- `01 Brand Kit`
- `02 Website`
- `03 Funnels`
- `04 Social`
- `05 Documents`
- `99 Archive`

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) Media Storage is used by: **Sites/Email/Social/Products** ✅  
2) True/False: Deleting an item always permanently removes it immediately. **False** ✅  
3) Why avoid duplicates? **Confusion + wrong assets used + clutter** ✅  
4) File limits can: **vary by product/module** ✅  
5) Built-in editor can do: **crop/rotate/basic adjustments** ✅  
6) A consistent folder system helps: **repeatable builds** ✅  
7) Safe deletion means: **use trash/restore when needed** ✅  
8) A “brand kit” should contain: **logos, icons, core images** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
- Create folder tree
- Upload 5 assets and rename consistently
- Delete 1 asset and restore it
- Provide screenshots: folder tree, trash, restored file

## Relatable metaphor — “Warehouse Shelving”
Media Storage is the warehouse shelving system. If every box is labeled and shelved, pickers (workflows/pages) can grab assets fast; if not, orders get delayed.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **New campaign assets arriving**
  - Decision: where to place? → Use department folders (ACQ/RET) and subfolders by offer; apply naming convention immediately.
  - Decision: versioning? → Append `v1`, `v2` in filenames and archive old versions in an `Archive` folder.
- **Missing asset link on a live page**
  - Decision: broken link or permissions? → Test the asset URL; if 404, re-upload and update references; if permission issue, adjust sharing or re-link via built-in library.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. Why avoid spaces in filenames? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Prevents URL encoding issues and makes links predictable.</details>
2. Which folder naming keeps assets discoverable? <details><summary>Answer</summary>`[DEPT]/[Offer]/[Type]` such as `ACQ/Advertiser Offer/Hero Images`.</details>
3. How do you confirm a link works on a page? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Open the link in an incognito tab and refresh the page using it.</details>
4. When should you archive vs delete? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Archive old versions to retain history unless there is a compliance reason to delete.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Asset kit build**
  - Deliverable: Organized asset pack for the advertiser offer (hero image, logo, PDF, video if available).
  - Evidence: Screenshots of folder structure, file details with copy links, and at least one page or workflow referencing the asset.
  - Rubric: Pass if assets follow naming conventions, links function, and references are documented.
