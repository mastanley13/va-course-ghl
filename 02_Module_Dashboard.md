# Module 02 — Dashboard (Sub-Account)

## Why it matters
The Dashboard is where VAs confirm account health, quickly access key areas, and spot “red flags” (failed workflows, missing integrations, unread messages).

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Navigate key dashboard widgets and understand what each means.
- Identify the 5 most common “account is broken” symptoms from the dashboard.
- Use dashboard → drill-down behavior to find the source module (Conversations, Payments, Calendars, etc.).

## Vocabulary
- **Widget**: dashboard block (e.g., appointments, conversations, revenue).
- **Drill-down**: clicking into the relevant module/details behind a widget.
- **KPI**: key performance indicator (appointments booked, leads, revenue, etc.).
- **Account health check**: quick checks to validate systems are running.

- Page 2: “Daily Checklist” mindset: how to scan in <5 minutes

### Section B — Practical Navigation

- Page 4: How to drill down into each metric

### Section C — Production SOP

- Page 6: Weekly “Build QA” dashboard checklist (after shipping new automation/site)

### Section D — Pitfalls & troubleshooting
- Page 7: Common dashboard inconsistencies (timezone, attribution, incomplete integrations)

### Section E — Quiz (100% required)
- Page 8: Quiz (8 questions)

### Section F — Lab
- Page 9: Hands-on: create a “Daily Ops” dashboard snapshot (screenshots)

## Production SOP — Daily Dashboard Checklist
1) Unread conversations count is not ignored (triage)
2) Appointment volume and no-show rate (spot issues)
3) Payment failures/refunds (spot revenue leakage)
4) Workflow errors/failed steps (if surfaced)
5) Lead volume vs historical baseline (if visible)

## Pitfalls
- Numbers don’t match other reports due to timezone differences.
- Revenue widgets may show opportunity value, not payments received (validate in Payments/Transactions).

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) Dashboard is primarily used to: (A) build funnels (B) manage company settings (C) **monitor account health + KPIs** ✅  
2) True/False: All dashboard numbers are always payments collected. **False** ✅  
3) If unread messages spike, which module do you check? **Conversations** ✅  
4) If bookings drop suddenly, which modules are likely involved? **Calendars + Sites/Forms + Workflows** ✅  
5) A “health check” should be done: (A) once a month (B) **daily** ✅  
6) What is drill-down? **Clicking a widget to see underlying details** ✅  
7) A dashboard anomaly you must investigate immediately: **payment failures** ✅  
8) If metrics look “off by a day,” what root cause is common? **Timezone mismatch** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
- Take screenshots of:
  1) dashboard overview
  2) drill-down into 2 metrics (appointments + conversations)
  3) note 3 signals you’d investigate and what module you would open next
Rubric: Pass if screenshots and explanations match the expected module mapping.

## Relatable metaphor — “Vitals Monitor in an ER”
The dashboard is the patient monitor in an emergency room. It shows pulse, pressure, and alerts. You don’t diagnose everything there, but you use it to decide which room to rush into next.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **Morning health check**
  - Decision: unread messages spike? → Jump to Conversations and assign owners before moving on.
  - Decision: bookings drop vs last week? → Drill into Calendars, then inspect Sites/Forms submissions.
- **Post-launch QA after new workflow**
  - Decision: revenue widget unchanged after promo? → Check Payments for failed attempts, then Opportunities for deal stage updates.
  - Decision: workflow errors indicator lit? → Open Automation → specific workflow error logs before toggling anything off.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. Which widget do you check first when inbox volume jumps? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Unread Conversations to confirm triage load.</details>
2. How do you verify if revenue drops are real vs tracking? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Compare Payments → Transactions with Opportunities values to rule out attribution gaps.</details>
3. What’s your next step if the timezone seems off? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Confirm sub-account timezone in Settings and re-run a spot check on the widget timestamps.</details>
4. When should you document a dashboard anomaly? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Immediately after you observe it, with a screenshot and a note on which module you will inspect.</details>
5. What drill-down behavior matters for KPIs? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Each widget should link to the source object list (conversations, appointments, payments) for root-cause review.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Daily Ops snapshot**
  - Deliverable: Screenshot of the dashboard plus a table listing 3 anomalies and the module you opened for each.
  - Evidence: Links/screenshots from the drill-down pages and notes on resolutions.
  - Rubric: Pass if anomalies are mapped to the correct modules, evidence shows drill-down views, and at least one corrective action is noted.
