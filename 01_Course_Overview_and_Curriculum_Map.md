# Course Overview — Curriculum Map + Standards (December 2025)

## Course Goal
Train and certify Technical VAs to build and operate **production-grade GoHighLevel sub-accounts**, with emphasis on:
- accurate navigation + configuration
- automation reliability
- AI-assisted personalization and qualification
- payment + fulfillment workflows
- measurable reporting

## Phases
### Phase 0 — Orientation (no quiz)
- How the course works (100% rule, evidence requirements)
- What “production grade” means: naming conventions, clean data, testing

### Phase 1 — Foundations (core setup)
1) **Settings + Labs**
2) **Dashboard** (orientation + shortcuts)
3) **Media Storage** (assets organization standard)

### Phase 2 — Core CRM + Operations
4) **Contacts**
5) **Conversations**
6) **Calendars**
7) **Opportunities**

### Phase 3 — Revenue + Growth
8) **Payments**
9) **Sites** (Funnels/Websites/Forms/Surveys/Chat Widget)
10) **Reputation** (widgets + review requests)

### Phase 4 — Automation + AI (the “power layer”)
11) **Automation (Workflows)** (including Scheduler Trigger)
12) **AI Agents** (Conversation AI + Agent Studio)
13) **Marketing** (Campaigns/Templates/Trigger Links/Ad Manager entry points)
14) **Reporting** (dashboards + custom reports + attribution)

### Phase 5 — Extensibility
15) **App Marketplace** (install/connect apps; workflow triggers/actions; permissions)

### Phase 6 — Capstone
16) **Capstone Build**: Golf Advertising Partner Acquisition + Fulfillment System

## Standard Module Format (for the IDE)
Each module becomes a linear sequence:
- Section A: What it is + why it matters
- Section B: UI map + objects (what data exists)
- Section C: Production SOP (exact build actions)
- Section D: QA + troubleshooting
- Section E: Quiz (100% to pass)
- Section F: Lab assignment + evidence submission (optional graded)
- Completion: auto-unlock next module

## Global Standards (must be consistent across all builds)
### Naming Conventions
- Workflows: `[DEPT] - [Purpose] - [Trigger] - v#` (e.g., `ACQ - Outbound Prospecting - Scheduler Daily - v1`)
- Tags: `stage:`, `src:`, `seg:`, `intent:`, `offer:`, `status:`
- Custom fields: prefix by object and purpose (`biz_industry`, `ad_budget`, `consent_sms`, etc.)
- Calendars: `[Team/Use] - [Type]` (e.g., `Vendor - Pickup Scheduling`)
- Pipelines: `Sales - Advertisers`, `Fulfillment - Sign Orders`

### Evidence Rules
Every lab/capstone step must be verifiable by:
- screenshot OR export OR link to live asset in the sub-account (test environment)

### Safety/Compliance
- Do not automate SMS/calls to cold lists without documented consent.
- All sequences must have stop conditions (“Stop on Response,” DND windows, max touches).
