# Course Overview — Curriculum Map + Standards (December 2025)

🔗 **Appendix:** [Plain Language + Glossary (A–Z with screenshots)](Appendix_Plain_Language_Glossary.md) — includes navigation verbs quick-reference (EN/ES/PH).

## Course Goal
Train and certify Technical VAs to build and operate **production-grade GoHighLevel sub-accounts**, with emphasis on:
- accurate navigation + configuration
- automation reliability
- AI-assisted personalization and qualification
- payment + fulfillment workflows
- measurable reporting

## Vocabulary
- **100% rule**: every quiz must be passed perfectly to unlock the next module
  - *What this means:* You cannot progress until you demonstrate full mastery, ensuring production-ready builds.
- **Production-grade**: naming standards, clean data, tested automations, and safe messaging
  - *What this means:* Each deliverable should be reliable enough for a live client without “we’ll fix it later” caveats.
- **Evidence**: screenshots, exports, or live links that prove a step was completed
  - *What this means:* You should save visual or file-based proof for every lab step so reviewers can verify the work.
- **Sub-account**: the client workspace inside HighLevel where all assets live
  - *What this means:* Treat each sub-account as its own environment with isolated settings, assets, and integrations.
- **Curriculum map**: ordered list of modules and dependencies
  - *What this means:* Follow the sequence shown so you don’t build automation before the prerequisites (settings, data) are ready.

## Phases
### Phase 0 — Orientation (no quiz)
- How the course works (100% rule, evidence requirements)
- What “production grade” means: naming conventions, clean data, testing

### Phase 1 — Foundations (core setup)
1) **Settings + Labs**
2) **Dashboard** (orientation + shortcuts)
3) **Media Storage** (assets organization standard)

### Phase 2 — Core CRM + Operations
4) **Contacts**
5) **Conversations**
6) **Calendars**
7) **Opportunities**

### Phase 3 — Revenue + Growth
8) **Payments**
9) **Sites** (Funnels/Websites/Forms/Surveys/Chat Widget)
10) **Reputation** (widgets + review requests)

### Phase 4 — Automation + AI (the “power layer”)
11) **Automation (Workflows)** (including Scheduler Trigger)
12) **AI Agents** (Conversation AI + Agent Studio)
13) **Marketing** (Campaigns/Templates/Trigger Links/Ad Manager entry points)
14) **Reporting** (dashboards + custom reports + attribution)

### Phase 5 — Extensibility
15) **App Marketplace** (install/connect apps; workflow triggers/actions; permissions)

### Phase 6 — Capstone
16) **Capstone Build**: Golf Advertising Partner Acquisition + Fulfillment System

## Standard Module Format (for the IDE)
Each module becomes a linear sequence:
- Section A: What it is + why it matters
- Section B: UI map + objects (what data exists)
- Section C: Production SOP (exact build actions)
- Section D: QA + troubleshooting
- Section E: Quiz (100% to pass)
- Section F: Lab assignment + evidence submission (optional graded)
- Completion: auto-unlock next module

## Global Standards (must be consistent across all builds)
### Naming Conventions
- Workflows: `[DEPT] - [Purpose] - [Trigger] - v#` (e.g., `ACQ - Outbound Prospecting - Scheduler Daily - v1`)
- Tags: `stage:`, `src:`, `seg:`, `intent:`, `offer:`, `status:`
- Custom fields: prefix by object and purpose (`biz_industry`, `ad_budget`, `consent_sms`, etc.)
- Calendars: `[Team/Use] - [Type]` (e.g., `Vendor - Pickup Scheduling`)
- Pipelines: `Sales - Advertisers`, `Fulfillment - Sign Orders`

### Evidence Rules
Every lab/capstone step must be verifiable by:
- screenshot OR export OR link to live asset in the sub-account (test environment)

### Safety/Compliance
- Do not automate SMS/calls to cold lists without documented consent.
- All sequences must have stop conditions (“Stop on Response,” DND windows, max touches).

## Relatable metaphor — “Airport Control Tower”
Think of the course as an airport control tower: every module is a runway that must be cleared, lit, and sequenced so aircraft (client projects) can land safely. Orientation is the briefing, Dashboard is the radar screen, and the remaining modules are the ground crews that keep traffic moving.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **New VA onboarding week**
  - Decision: Start with Dashboard or Settings? → Start with Dashboard to see live signals, then Settings to stabilize connections.
  - Decision: Where to log questions? → In the shared notebook linked from each module’s lab.
- **First client import**
  - Decision: proceed without naming conventions? → No; pause and apply the naming standards before importing.
  - Decision: Missing consent records? → Do not automate until opt-in is verified and logged.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. What is the “100% rule” and why is it enforced? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Every quiz must be passed at 100% to unlock the next module to ensure production-readiness.</details>
2. Which two modules form the baseline for all others? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Dashboard (health signals) and Settings + Labs (system stability and toggles).</details>
3. When should you pause automation work during onboarding? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Whenever consent status is unclear or naming conventions are not yet applied.</details>
4. Where do you record evidence after each lab? <details><summary>Answer</summary>In the linked lab submission space with screenshots/exports noted in the rubric.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab 0: Map your runway plan**
  - Deliverable: A one-page sequence showing how you will complete modules (with dates and dependencies).
  - Evidence: Screenshot of your plan plus notes on when you will gather sample data for testing.
  - Rubric: Pass if dependencies are logical (Dashboard → Settings → Core modules), evidence is time-stamped, and next steps are clearly assigned.
