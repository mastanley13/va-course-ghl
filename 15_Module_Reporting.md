# Module 15 — Reporting (Dashboards + Custom Reports + Attribution)

## Why it matters
Reporting proves the system works and tells you where to improve. For capstone, reporting must answer:
- Are we generating new advertiser leads?
- Which channels convert?
- How long does it take to go from lead → paid?
- What’s the fulfillment throughput?

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Explain attribution at a high level (first vs latest).
- Build a dashboard for weekly KPIs.
- Convert dashboards into custom reports (or build a report from scratch).
- Identify common reporting discrepancies (timezone, opportunity value vs payment totals).

## Vocabulary
- **Attribution**: source/channel that generated lead
- **First vs latest attribution**: original source vs most recent source
- **Dashboard**: KPI view
- **Custom report**: scheduled/shareable report output
- **KPI**: measurable metric (leads, bookings, won deals, revenue)
