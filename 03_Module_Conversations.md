# Module 03 — Conversations (Sub-Account)

## Why it matters
Conversations is the operational heart: SMS, email, chat, social DMs—where leads are triaged, qualified, and moved into appointments and deals.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Operate the inbox efficiently (filtering, tagging, assignment).
- Use templates/snippets appropriately without sounding robotic.
- Hand off to AI agents (when configured) and know when to escalate to humans.
- Keep conversations “production clean” (proper outcomes logged and pipeline updated).

## Key platform notes (Dec 2025)
- HighLevel has a redesigned Conversations experience that may be enabled via Labs (Agency-level toggle). It uses a 4-panel layout and advanced filtering with AND/OR logic.

## Vocabulary
- **Inbox**: list of conversations across channels
- **Thread**: message history with a contact
- **Assignment**: which user owns the conversation
- **Tags**: conversation or contact tags used for filtering/routing
- **Internal comment**: team-only note (not visible to customer)
- **Snippets / templates**: reusable text blocks
- **Stop on response**: automation setting that pauses sequences when a contact replies
- **Handoff**: AI → human escalation

- Page 6: Using snippets/templates responsibly
- Page 7: Escalation rules + internal comments

### Section D — QA + troubleshooting
- Page 8: Why replies sometimes don’t “stop” workflows (reply settings, stop-on-response configuration)
- Page 9: Common failures: wrong sender, wrong channel, unassigned conversations

### Section E — Quiz (100% required)
- Page 10: Quiz (10 questions)

### Section F — Lab
- Page 11: Inbox triage simulation (screenshots)

## Production SOP — Triage to Outcome
Every inbound conversation must end with ONE of:
- Booked appointment (Calendar booking link sent / appointment created)
- Qualified and moved to pipeline stage
- Disqualified (tag + close reason)
- Follow-up sequence started (workflow enrolled)
- Escalated to human (assigned + internal note)

## Common pitfalls
- “New Conversations UI” missing because Labs not enabled.
- Reply tracking issues can prevent stop-on-response behavior (requires correct email reply/forward settings).
- Overusing AI or templates causes poor deliverability and spam complaints.

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) The primary job of Conversations is: **manage multi-channel customer messaging** ✅  
2) True/False: Internal comments are visible to the lead. **False** ✅  
3) If a lead asks for a human, your next step is: **assign + notify owner, stop automation** ✅  
4) Stop-on-response exists to: **prevent over-messaging after a reply** ✅  
5) Best practice for templates: **personalize key lines; keep it human** ✅  
6) If you need to move a lead into sales tracking, open: **Opportunities** ✅  
7) If the lead requests a price sheet, best delivery method is: **email with PDF or link + track click** ✅  
8) Which module is connected to live chat widget? **Sites → Chat Widget** ✅  
9) Inbox triage should be done: **daily (or multiple times daily)** ✅  
10) If messages are sending at 2am, what should you check? **Workflow timing / quiet hours** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
- Create a triage board (your own rubric):
  - label 5 conversation outcomes
- Provide screenshots of:
  1) inbox filters/tags
  2) a conversation thread with an internal comment
  3) a snippet/template edit screen (if available)
Rubric: Pass if the VA demonstrates filter use, internal notes, and correct outcome mapping.
