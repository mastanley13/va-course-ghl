# Module 03 — Conversations (Sub-Account)

## Why it matters
Conversations is the operational heart: SMS, email, chat, social DMs—where leads are triaged, qualified, and moved into appointments and deals.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Operate the inbox efficiently (filtering, tagging, assignment).
- Use templates/snippets appropriately without sounding robotic.
- Hand off to AI agents (when configured) and know when to escalate to humans.
- Keep conversations “production clean” (proper outcomes logged and pipeline updated).

## Key platform notes (Dec 2025)
- HighLevel has a redesigned Conversations experience that may be enabled via Labs (Agency-level toggle). It uses a 4-panel layout and advanced filtering with AND/OR logic.

## Vocabulary
- **Inbox**: list of conversations across channels
- **Thread**: message history with a contact
- **Assignment**: which user owns the conversation
- **Tags**: conversation or contact tags used for filtering/routing
- **Internal comment**: team-only note (not visible to customer)
- **Snippets / templates**: reusable text blocks
- **Stop on response**: automation setting that pauses sequences when a contact replies
- **Handoff**: AI → human escalation

## Production SOP — Triage to Outcome
Every inbound conversation must end with ONE of:
- Booked appointment (Calendar booking link sent / appointment created)
- Qualified and moved to pipeline stage
- Disqualified (tag + close reason)
- Follow-up sequence started (workflow enrolled)
- Escalated to human (assigned + internal note)

## Common pitfalls
- “New Conversations UI” missing because Labs not enabled.
- Reply tracking issues can prevent stop-on-response behavior (requires correct email reply/forward settings).
- Overusing AI or templates causes poor deliverability and spam complaints.

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) The primary job of Conversations is: **manage multi-channel customer messaging** ✅  
2) True/False: Internal comments are visible to the lead. **False** ✅  
3) If a lead asks for a human, your next step is: **assign + notify owner, stop automation** ✅  
4) Stop-on-response exists to: **prevent over-messaging after a reply** ✅  
5) Best practice for templates: **personalize key lines; keep it human** ✅  
6) If you need to move a lead into sales tracking, open: **Opportunities** ✅  
7) If the lead requests a price sheet, best delivery method is: **email with PDF or link + track click** ✅  
8) Which module is connected to live chat widget? **Sites → Chat Widget** ✅  
9) Inbox triage should be done: **daily (or multiple times daily)** ✅  
10) If messages are sending at 2am, what should you check? **Workflow timing / quiet hours** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
- Create a triage board (your own rubric):
  - label 5 conversation outcomes
- Provide screenshots of:
  1) inbox filters/tags
  2) a conversation thread with an internal comment
  3) a snippet/template edit screen (if available)
Rubric: Pass if the VA demonstrates filter use, internal notes, and correct outcome mapping.

## Relatable metaphor — “Hotel Front Desk”
Conversations is the hotel front desk: every guest question, complaint, or booking request lands here first. The goal is to route each guest to the right service quickly without losing their luggage (context).

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **Spike of unread messages after a campaign**
  - Decision: bulk reply with a template? → Only after tagging and segmenting; personalize key lines for top-value leads.
  - Decision: Which channel to prioritize? → Start with inbound calls/voicemails, then SMS, then email.
- **AI agent escalation**
  - Decision: AI stuck in a loop? → Add an internal comment, stop the workflow, and reassign to a human.
  - Decision: Lead requests pricing? → Send the approved snippet and log the outcome in Opportunities.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. Which filter removes closed threads from your triage view? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Status or “Open only” filter.</details>
2. What should you add after escalating to a human? <details><summary>Answer</summary>An internal comment with context and an assignment change.</details>
3. When should you avoid bulk-sending a template? <details><summary>Answer</summary>When contacts are in different stages or have open tickets that need personalized answers.</details>
4. Which module do you update after confirming an appointment by SMS? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Calendars for the booking and Opportunities for the stage change.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Triage drill**
  - Deliverable: Clear five mixed-channel messages to defined outcomes using filters, tags, and assignments.
  - Evidence: Screenshots of filters used, one conversation with an internal note, and the final outcome tags/stages applied.
  - Rubric: Pass if every thread has a documented outcome, internal notes are present for escalations, and channel-appropriate replies are shown.
