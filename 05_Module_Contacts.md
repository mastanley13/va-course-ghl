# Module 05 — Contacts (Smart Lists, Bulk Actions, Imports)

## Why it matters
Contacts are the database. If contact data is messy, every workflow, report, and AI personalization gets worse.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Create and manage Smart Lists (dynamic filters).
- Import contacts safely via CSV.
- Use bulk actions responsibly (tags, deletes, exports).
- Create and maintain clean contact records for automation and reporting.

## Compliance note (critical)
Bulk importing contacts without proper consent can damage deliverability and increase spam/bounce rates. Purchased/rented lists are risky and often unsuitable for marketing tools.

## Vocabulary
- **Contact record**: the CRM profile for a person/business
- **Smart List**: dynamic list that updates automatically based on filters
- **Custom fields**: structured fields for additional data
- **Tags**: labels for segmentation and automation triggers
- **Bulk actions**: batch operations (tag, delete, export)
- **Dedupe**: preventing duplicate contacts (email/phone matching)
- **Consent**: permission flags for outreach (especially SMS)

- Page 6: Bulk actions (tags, export, delete, restore)

### Section D — Production SOP
- Page 7: “Clean contact” SOP (required fields + formatting)
- Page 8: Consent + deliverability SOP (do not spam)

### Section E — Quiz
- Page 9: Quiz (10 questions)

### Section F — Lab
- Page 10: Build 3 Smart Lists + import a test CSV

## Production SOP — Clean contact minimum standard
- Required fields: Name, business name (if B2B), email OR phone, source, owner
- Normalize phone to E.164 format if possible
- Apply tags consistently (e.g., `src:leadlist`, `seg:real-estate`, `status:new`)
- Add notes for context
- Assign owner if a rep is responsible

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) Smart Lists are: **dynamic lists based on filters** ✅  
2) True/False: Smart Lists update automatically when contacts match filters. **True** ✅  
3) CSV import should only be done with: **proper consent and clean data** ✅  
4) A tag is used for: **segmentation and workflow triggers** ✅  
5) Best practice for duplicates: **dedupe on email/phone; avoid double imports** ✅  
6) Bulk delete is safe because: **you can restore if supported; still risky—use carefully** ✅  
7) A “source” tag helps with: **reporting and attribution sanity** ✅  
8) If you want a list of businesses in a city, you’d create: **a Smart List with location filter** ✅  
9) Purchased lists can cause: **spam complaints/bounces and deliverability damage** ✅  
10) A custom field should be used when: **you need structured data reused in automations/reports** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
1) Create Smart Lists:
   - `SL - New Prospects (No Owner)`
   - `SL - Advertiser Leads (Interested)`
   - `SL - Vendors (Sign Company)`
2) Import a small CSV (5–10 contacts) into a test sub-account.
3) Apply a bulk tag to imported contacts.
Evidence:
- screenshots of each Smart List filters
- screenshot of import summary
Rubric: Pass if lists are correct and tags applied without errors.

## Relatable metaphor — “Library Card Catalog”
Contacts are the card catalog for the business. If the cards are misfiled or mislabeled, nobody can find the right book (lead) when it’s needed.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **CSV import with missing consent**
  - Decision: import now or pause? → Pause and request proof of consent; tag records appropriately once verified.
  - Decision: mapping unclear for phone? → Standardize to E.164 and map primary phone only once.
- **Duplicate detection**
  - Decision: merge or keep separate? → Merge when identifiers match (email/phone) and notes show same person; otherwise tag for review.
  - Decision: which custom fields to keep? → Retain the most recent verified data and log changes in notes.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. Which two identifiers drive deduplication? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Email and phone.</details>
2. Why use standardized phone formatting? <details><summary>Answer</summary>To prevent duplicate creation and improve deliverability/routing.</details>
3. What tag prefix should you use for source? <details><summary>Answer</summary>`src:` per the naming convention.</details>
4. How do you document consent status? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Apply a consent field/tag and note the proof location in the record.</details>
5. Which module should be checked after a bulk import? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Automation/Workflows to ensure sequences are paused until QA is complete.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Clean import**
  - Deliverable: Import sample contacts with tags and at least three custom fields populated.
  - Evidence: Screenshots of mapping, one merged duplicate example, and a before/after contact timeline.
  - Rubric: Pass if mappings follow standards, deduplication is demonstrated, and consent + source tagging are visible.
