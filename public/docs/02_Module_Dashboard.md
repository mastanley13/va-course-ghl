# Module 02 — Dashboard (Sub-Account)

## Why it matters
The Dashboard is where VAs confirm account health, quickly access key areas, and spot “red flags” (failed workflows, missing integrations, unread messages).

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Navigate key dashboard widgets and understand what each means.
- Identify the 5 most common “account is broken” symptoms from the dashboard.
- Use dashboard → drill-down behavior to find the source module (Conversations, Payments, Calendars, etc.).

## Vocabulary
- **Widget**: dashboard block (e.g., appointments, conversations, revenue).
- **Drill-down**: clicking into the relevant module/details behind a widget.
- **KPI**: key performance indicator (appointments booked, leads, revenue, etc.).
- **Account health check**: quick checks to validate systems are running.

## Course sections and pages
### Section A — Orientation
- Page 1: What the Dashboard is used for (VA perspective)
- Page 2: “Daily Checklist” mindset: how to scan in <5 minutes

### Section B — Practical Navigation
- Page 3: Where dashboard data comes from (Contacts / Opportunities / Calendars / Payments / Conversations)
- Page 4: How to drill down into each metric

### Section C — Production SOP
- Page 5: Daily Dashboard SOP checklist
- Page 6: Weekly “Build QA” dashboard checklist (after shipping new automation/site)

### Section D — Pitfalls & troubleshooting
- Page 7: Common dashboard inconsistencies (timezone, attribution, incomplete integrations)

### Section E — Quiz (100% required)
- Page 8: Quiz (8 questions)

### Section F — Lab
- Page 9: Hands-on: create a “Daily Ops” dashboard snapshot (screenshots)

## Production SOP — Daily Dashboard Checklist
1) Unread conversations count is not ignored (triage)
2) Appointment volume and no-show rate (spot issues)
3) Payment failures/refunds (spot revenue leakage)
4) Workflow errors/failed steps (if surfaced)
5) Lead volume vs historical baseline (if visible)

## Pitfalls
- Numbers don’t match other reports due to timezone differences.
- Revenue widgets may show opportunity value, not payments received (validate in Payments/Transactions).

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) Dashboard is primarily used to: (A) build funnels (B) manage company settings (C) **monitor account health + KPIs** ✅  
2) True/False: All dashboard numbers are always payments collected. **False** ✅  
3) If unread messages spike, which module do you check? **Conversations** ✅  
4) If bookings drop suddenly, which modules are likely involved? **Calendars + Sites/Forms + Workflows** ✅  
5) A “health check” should be done: (A) once a month (B) **daily** ✅  
6) What is drill-down? **Clicking a widget to see underlying details** ✅  
7) A dashboard anomaly you must investigate immediately: **payment failures** ✅  
8) If metrics look “off by a day,” what root cause is common? **Timezone mismatch** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
- Take screenshots of:
  1) dashboard overview
  2) drill-down into 2 metrics (appointments + conversations)
  3) note 3 signals you’d investigate and what module you would open next
Rubric: Pass if screenshots and explanations match the expected module mapping.
