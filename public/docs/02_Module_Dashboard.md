# Module 02 — Dashboard & Launchpad (Sub-Account)

## Why it matters
The Dashboard is the "Command Center" for the sub-account. It is the first screen a business owner sees. **If the Dashboard looks broken, the client thinks the system is broken.**
VAs must master this view to perform "Health Checks" in under 60 seconds.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- **Distinguish** between the "Launchpad" (setup only) and "Dashboard" (daily ops).
- **Configure Widgets**: Customize the view to show *only* relevant KPIs (e.g., hiding "Calls" for clients who don't call).
- **Analyze Pipeline Value**: Interpret "Open," "Won," and "Lost" values to spot sales bottlenecks.
- **Drill Down**: Click through visual charts to find the specific leads stuck in a pipeline stage.

## Vocabulary
- **Launchpad**: The onboarding checklist screen (Connect GMB, Stripe, Chat Widget). Used *once* during setup, then ignored.
- **Widgets**: Individual data blocks on the Dashboard (e.g., "Opportunity Status," "Conversion Rate," "Manual Actions").
- **Pipeline Value**: A projected dollar amount based on leads currently in the funnel. (Requires `Lead Value` to be set in pipeline settings).
- **Conversion Rate**: The percentage of leads moving to "Won" status.

## Quiz (Verified Bank)
1) What is the primary difference between **Launchpad** and **Dashboard**?  
   (A) Launchpad is for setup/integrations; Dashboard is for daily metrics. ✅  
   (B) They are the same thing.  
   (C) Dashboard is for billing only.

2) If a client says "My Dashboard shows $0 Pipeline Value," what is the most likely technical cause?  
   (A) They have no leads.  
   (B) **Lead Status** is "Lost".  
   (C) **Lead Value** is not defined in the Pipeline Settings. ✅

3) Which widget would you check to see if the AI Booking Bot is failing to close deals?  
   (A) Google Verify  
   (B) **Funnel / Stages Distribution** (Leads stacking in "New Lead" vs "Booked"). ✅  
   (C) Manual Actions.

4) True/False: You can hide the "Google Analytics" widget if the client doesn't use it. **True** ✅

## Lab Assignment: "The Red Flag Hunt"
**Scenario:** You log into a client account on Monday morning.
**Task:** Review the Dashboard and identify 3 critical issues.

**Cues provided:**
1. "Unread Conversations" widget shows **42**.
2. "Manual Actions" widget shows **15** pending calls.
3. "Opportunity Status" shows 100% "Open" (0 Won, 0 Lost) over 6 months.

**Deliverable:**
Write a 3-bullet slack update to the client explaining **what is wrong** and **what specific module** you are going to fix next.
*Example:*
*   *Issue 1: 42 Unread messages. Action: Going to **Conversations** tab to triage immediately.*
*   *Issue 2: 0 Won/Lost deals. Action: Checking **Opportunities** pipeline to see if automation is failing to update status.*
