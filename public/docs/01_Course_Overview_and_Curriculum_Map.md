# Course Overview (Welcome to the Team)

## 1. What the heck is "HighLevel"?
Imagine if **Salesforce**, **Mailchimp**, **Calendly**, **WordPress**, and **Zapier** all had a baby. That is HighLevel (GHL).
It is an "All-In-One" Operating System for businesses.
*   **Old Way:** A business pays for 10 different tools and tries to glue them together.
*   **New Way:** They use HighLevel. One login. One bill. Everything connects.

## 2. Your Role as a "Technical VA"
You are not just a data entry clerk. You are the **Engine Mechanic**.
Business owners are busy selling. They need YOU to:
1.  **Build the Machine:** Set up the calendars, funnels, and automations.
2.  **Keep it Running:** Fix broken links, reply to support tickets, and manage leads.
3.  **Make it Better:** Suggest new automations to save time.

## 3. The Roadmap (How we will learn)
We don't just watch videos here. We **build**.
The course is broken down into simple phases to take you from "Newbie" to "Architect".

### Phase 1: The Basics (Setting up the Shop)
*   **Media Storage:** Where do we put images?
*   **Contacts:** Who are we talking to?
*   **Conversations:** How do we text/email them?

### Phase 2: Operations (Making Money)
*   **Calendars:** Booking appointments.
*   **Payments:** Getting paid (Invoices/Products).
*   **Opportunities:** Tracking the sales deals.

### Phase 3: The "Wow" Stuff (Automation & Sites)
*   **Sites:** Building Funnels and Websites.
*   **Automations:** The "Magic" engine that communicates while you sleep.
*   **AI Agents:** Setting up bots to talk for you.

## 4. How to Succeed
*   **Don't Panic:** GHL is huge. Nobody knows 100% of it. Just focus on the module in front of you.
*   **Click Everything:** You can't break the "Lab" account. Try things out!
*   **Ask Questions:** If an automation doesn't work, that's good! Figuring out *why* is how you learn.

Let's get started with your Orientation.
