# Orientation Sprint (Getting Comfortable)

Welcome! Before we dive into the deep end, let's just get comfortable in the pool.
Your goal right now is simple: **Log in and look around.**

## 1. The Map (finding your way)
GHL has a sidebar on the left. Think of it like a smartphone menu.
*   **Conversations:** Your text/email inbox.
*   **Calendars:** Your appointment book.
*   **Contacts:** Your address book.
*   **Sites:** Your website builder.
*   **Automation:** Your robot builders.

**Action:** Click each one just to see what it looks like. Don't worry about breaking anything.

## 2. Show Your Work (Evidence)
As a VA, trust is everything. The best way to build trust is to **show your work**.
When you finish a task, take a quick screenshot.
*   *Bad Report:* "I fixed the calendar."
*   *Good Report:* "I fixed the calendar. Here is a screenshot of the new settings."

## 3. Think Before You Automate
Automation is powerful, but it can be dangerous if we aren't careful.
*   **Rule #1:** Always send a "test email" to yourself before sending it to 1,000 people.
*   **Rule #2:** If you are confused, ask! It is better to ask and get it right than to guess and send a broken link.
