# Orientation Sprint

Welcome to the Orientation Sprint. Complete these three micro-lessons and pass the 5-question quiz with a perfect score to unlock every core module.

## Micro-lesson: Navigation map
- Trace the fastest path to common destinations (e.g., Workflows > Triggers, Sites > Forms, Payments > Products).
- Bookmark the platform map you build during this sprint; reuse it for client handoffs.
- Use the search bar and breadcrumb trails to validate you are in the correct sub-account before making changes.

## Micro-lesson: Evidence rules
- Capture evidence as you work, not afterward.
- Pair each configuration change with a proof artifact: annotated screenshot, short Loom clip, or exported setting.
- Name evidence files with the pattern `client-feature-step#-result` so reviewers can audit quickly.

## Micro-lesson: Safe automation defaults
- Import or clone workflows in a paused state and label the launch criteria in the description.
- Add safety checks: owner notifications, volume caps, and “stop after conversion” rules.
- Log every schedule change (who, what, when) inside the workflow notes before activation.

## Orientation deliverables
- Score 100% on the Orientation Sprint quiz to unlock Modules 1-16.
- Add at least one navigation path, one evidence example, and one safety rule to your lab notes.
