# Module 12 — Memberships & Communities (The Campus)

## 1. Why it matters
Stop paying for Kajabi, Skool, and Teachable. GHL does it all.
Most VAs just "upload videos". You will build **Universities**.
1.  **Memberships:** Host the content (Videos/PDFs).
2.  **Communities:** Host the conversation (Groups/Chats).
3.  **Certificates:** Reward the completion.

## 2. Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- **Architect the Campus:** Understand the "Product vs Offer" relationship.
- **Gamify the Experience:** Build a Skool-style Community with leaderboards.
- **Verify Knowledge:** Set up "Drip Schedules" and "Passing Grade" quizzes.
- **Issue Credentials:** Auto-generate a PDF Certificate upon course completion.

## 3. Tier 1: Memberships (The Library)
**Structure:**
*   **Product:** The Course itself (e.g., "SEO Masterclass").
*   **Offer:** The Pricing Plan (e.g., "Free Bundle" or "$97 One-Time").
*   *Key Concept:* One Product can belong to MANY Offers. (e.g., SEO Masterclass is sold separately for $97, OR included in the $297 "All Access Pass").

### The "Drip" SOP
Don't overwhelm students.
1.  **Setting:** Inside a Product > Category Settings.
2.  **Drip by Days:** Unlock "Module 2" 7 days after signup.
3.  **Lock by Progress:** Customer *must* complete "Module 1" to see "Module 2".

## 4. Tier 2: Communities (The Quad)
**Goal:** Replace Facebook Groups & Skool.
**Setup:** Membership > Communities > Create Group.

### Channel Types
1.  **Feed:** Like a Facebook Group (Posts, comments, likes). Best for "Announcements" or "Wins".
2.  **Chat:** Like Slack/Discord (Real-time messaging). Best for "General Chat" or "Support".

### Gamification (The Sticky Factor)
*   **Levels:** Users earn points for posting/liking.
*   **Rewards:**
    *   *Level 1:* Newbie.
    *   *Level 5:* Unlock a **Free Course** (Automation: Trigger "Level Up" -> Grant Offer).

---

## 5. Tier 3: Certificates (The Diploma)
**The Validation:** Clients love proof.
**Setup:**
1.  **Builder:** Memberships > Certificates > New.
2.  **Fields:** Drag "User Name", "Course Name", and "Completion Date".
3.  **Trigger:**
    *   *When:* Product Completed.
    *   *Action:* Issue Certificate.
    *   *Email:* Send PDF attachment to user.

## 7. Production SOP (User Experience)
1.  **Magic Links:** Always use "Magic Links" in your Welcome Email so users log in with 1 click.
2.  **Mobile App:** Instruct clients to download the "Client App" (white-label or generic) to access courses on the go.
3.  **Testing:** Log in as a "Student" (incognito window) to verify permissions weekly.
