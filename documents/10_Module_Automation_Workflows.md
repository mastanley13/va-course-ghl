# Module 10 — Automation (Workflows)

🔗 **Appendix:** [Plain Language + Glossary (A–Z with screenshots)](Appendix_Plain_Language_Glossary.md) — includes navigation verbs quick-reference (EN/ES/PH).

## Why it matters
Workflows are the system’s engine. The capstone is fundamentally a set of workflows that:
- runs daily recurring list operations (Scheduler Trigger)
- executes multi-channel outreach sequences
- routes by intent
- stops on response and respects quiet hours
- triggers payment, fulfillment, and vendor notifications

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Build workflows from scratch with correct triggers and actions.
- Use Wait steps and timing controls safely.
- Use Stop-on-response and correct call/voicemail settings.
- Use Scheduler Trigger to run contactless recurring jobs (daily, weekly, cron).
- Use webhooks (outbound/inbound conceptually) for integrations.
- Use AI actions (GPT, AI Decision Maker) responsibly (cost + reliability).

## Vocabulary
- **Trigger**: event that starts workflow (contact event, webhook, scheduler, etc.)
  - *What this means:* Triggers decide when a workflow runs—no trigger, no automation.
- **Action**: step in workflow (send SMS, add tag, webhook, create task, voicemail)
  - *What this means:* Actions are the tasks the workflow performs after it starts.
- **Wait**: delays next steps; can be time-based or condition-based
  - *What this means:* Wait steps space out actions so contacts aren’t overwhelmed and logic can check for updates.
- **Stop on response**: pauses/stops messaging when contact replies
  - *What this means:* This prevents double-messaging once someone responds.
- **Scheduler Trigger**: contactless scheduled workflow trigger (hourly/daily/cron)
  - *What this means:* Use Scheduler when you need automations to run on a time basis instead of per contact.
- **Webhook (Outbound)**: send data from GHL to external system
  - *What this means:* Outbound webhooks push HighLevel data to another app via URL.
- **Webhook (Inbound)**: external system triggers a workflow in GHL
  - *What this means:* Inbound webhooks start a workflow when another system sends data into HighLevel.
- **Voicemail (drop)**: send pre-recorded voicemail message
  - *What this means:* The system leaves a recorded voicemail without ringing the phone like a normal call.
- **AI Decision Maker / GPT action**: AI-powered workflow actions (often premium)
  - *What this means:* These steps use AI to classify or generate text, so monitor cost and accuracy.

## Production SOP — Workflow build rules
- Name every workflow clearly (department/purpose/trigger/version).
- Add a “test mode” toggle (tag-based) so you can run safely.
- Always include:
  - stop conditions
  - quiet hours
  - max touches per day
- Log key events:
  - tag or note on contact timeline at each milestone
- Build with recoverability:
  - if webhook fails, create task + alert team

7) Voicemail action sends: **pre-recorded voicemail file to contact** ✅  
8) Quiet hours are configured in: **workflow settings** ✅  
9) A “test tag” is used to: **prevent sending to real prospects during testing** ✅  
10) AI actions should be used: **intentionally and measured (cost/reliability)** ✅  
11) Contactless workflows should focus on: **contactless actions (tasks, webhooks, sheets)** ✅  
12) Workflows should always be: **tested end-to-end** ✅  
13) A re-engagement sequence should stop when: **lead commits or opts out** ✅
14) If a step fails, you should: **alert + create task + allow recovery** ✅
15) Workflow naming should include: **purpose + trigger + version** ✅

## Relatable metaphor — “Factory Robot Arm”
Automation is the robot arm on the production line: it performs repeatable tasks consistently and stops when a safety sensor (conditions) is tripped.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **New lead from form**
  - Decision: start workflow instantly or delay? → Start instantly for confirmation, delay outreach if consent/timezone uncertain.
  - Decision: what stops the workflow? → Stop on response or when opportunity stage changes.
- **Workflow failing mid-run**
  - Decision: is trigger correct? → Check enrollment history and filters first.
  - Decision: retries vs manual fix? → Retry after correcting settings; if data missing, branch to human task creation.
