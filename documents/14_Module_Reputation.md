# Module 14 — Reputation (Reviews + Widgets)

🔗 **Appendix:** [Plain Language + Glossary (A–Z with screenshots)](Appendix_Plain_Language_Glossary.md) — includes navigation verbs quick-reference (EN/ES/PH).

## Why it matters
Reputation turns trust into conversions. For production builds, VAs must:
- send review requests correctly (without spam)
- display reviews on websites via widgets
- maintain clean review sources and consistent messaging

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Configure review request messaging (SMS + email).
- Use the correct request mode (manual, bulk, automated).
- Build and embed a review widget on a funnel/website page.
- Understand multi-link distribution if multiple review URLs exist.

## Vocabulary
- **Review request**: outreach asking for a review
- **Widget**: embedded display of reviews
- **Source**: Google/Facebook review source
- **Distribution**: spreading requests across multiple links
- **AI summary**: automated summary of review sentiment (if enabled)

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) Reputation widgets are used to: **display reviews as social proof** ✅  
2) Review requests should be: **timed and compliant, not spam** ✅  
3) Messaging templates exist for: **SMS and email** ✅  
4) Automated mode is used for: **ongoing review request system** ✅  
5) A widget filter can: **show only high-star reviews** ✅  
6) A widget can be embedded in: **Sites/Funnels** ✅  
7) Multi-link distribution helps: **spread requests across multiple URLs** ✅  
8) True/False: You should request reviews every day from the same customer. **False** ✅  
9) Reviews support: **conversion rate improvement** ✅  
10) Widget QA requires: **desktop + mobile checks** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
**Goal:** Simulate a review request.
1) Reputation → Requests: send a review request to a test contact (yourself). If sending isn’t possible, fill out the request form and capture the configured message. Screenshot the sent request/list entry.
2) Reviews view: If manual review entry is available, add a dummy 5-star review (John Doe, “Great service!”); if not available, note the limitation and screenshot the empty Reviews dashboard to show location.
3) (Optional) Review widget: Locate the widget/embed code and note where you’d place it on a page; screenshot the widget settings if visible.
4) Reflection: Answer “Why respond to reviews promptly?” in one sentence (expected: engagement/SEO/trust).
Evidence: Screenshot of the request initiation/list, Reviews dashboard or dummy review, optional widget settings, and the reflection sentence. Rubric: Pass if a request flow is demonstrated and the reflection is present; optional widget is a bonus.

## Relatable metaphor — “Public Scoreboard”
Reputation is the public scoreboard. Good plays (reviews) should be showcased, and bad plays need quick coaching and response.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **New location onboarding**
  - Decision: which sites to connect? → Connect Google and Facebook if policy allows; note login ownership.
  - Decision: where to place widget? → On offer pages and thank-you pages near testimonials.
- **Negative review arrives**
  - Decision: respond or escalate? → Draft a calm reply and escalate to the account owner before posting if sensitive.
  - Decision: automation for unhappy score? → Trigger a “save” workflow when rating ≤3.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. When should you avoid sending review requests? <details><summary>Answer</summary>When consent is unclear or the service experience is unresolved.</details>
2. What triggers a save workflow? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Low-star feedback (e.g., 1–3 stars) or negative sentiment.</details>
3. Where do you place trust badges on a page? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Near CTAs and social proof sections.</details>
4. How do you prevent duplicate requests? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Use tags/stages to mark “review requested” and filter future sends.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Review request simulation**
  - Deliverable: Sent (or configured) review request with Reviews dashboard/widget location noted.
  - Evidence: Request screenshot, Reviews page or dummy review, optional widget settings, and the prompt-response reflection.
  - Rubric: Pass if the request flow is shown and the reflection explains why fast responses matter; widget evidence is optional but encouraged.
