# Module 11 — Sites (Funnels, Websites, Forms, Surveys, Chat Widget)

🔗 **Appendix:** [Plain Language + Glossary (A–Z with screenshots)](Appendix_Plain_Language_Glossary.md) — includes navigation verbs quick-reference (EN/ES/PH).

## Why it matters
Sites is where the conversion happens: landing pages, booking pages, proposal pages, and form/survey capture. For capstone: an advertiser offer page + optional PDF download + booking page and/or payment step.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Build a simple funnel/website page in the builder.
- Create forms and surveys and embed them.
- Configure domains, SEO basics, and tracking codes.
- Deploy chat widget for live/AI chat where appropriate.

## Vocabulary
- **Funnel**: step-based pages, often conversion flow; supports A/B testing
- **Website**: multi-page site; includes store options (if enabled)
- **Page builder**: section/row/column/element structure
- **Form**: lead capture
- **Survey**: multi-step intake/qualifier; conditional logic where supported
- **Chat widget**: website chat entry point into Conversations

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
Create funnel: `FNL - Advertiser Offer`
Steps:
1) Landing: offer + form
2) Thank-you: next steps + booking link

Evidence:
- public preview links
- screenshot of mobile view
- screenshot of form submission test creating a contact
Rubric: Pass if funnel works end-to-end.

## Relatable metaphor — “Storefront + Checkout”
Sites/Funnels are the storefront windows and the checkout counter. If the doors are blocked or the cash register isn’t connected, traffic doesn’t turn into customers.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **New offer landing page**
  - Decision: use form or direct calendar? → Use form when qualification needed; direct calendar for warm traffic ready to book.
  - Decision: where to place trust signals? → Above-the-fold for ads, near CTAs for organic visitors.
- **Broken form submissions**
  - Decision: is issue form or automation? → Submit a test; if submission appears in Contacts but no workflow, fix trigger; if not appearing, check form fields/consent settings and publish status.

## UI callouts + screenshot placeholders
- [Screenshot: Funnel builder with sections labeled (hero, form, CTA)]
- [Screenshot: Form settings showing required fields and consent]
- [Screenshot: Thank-you page with redirect/next steps annotated]

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. When should you add a consent checkbox? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Whenever collecting SMS/email for follow-up in regulated regions.</details>
2. Why use a two-step funnel? <details><summary>Answer</summary>To capture contact info first, then present booking/payment on step two for higher completion.</details>
3. What checks ensure the CTA works? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Test the button link/redirect, confirm form submission reaches Contacts, and validate automation trigger fires.</details>
4. Where do you adjust mobile padding? <details><summary>Answer</summary>In the responsive settings of each section/element within the builder.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Conversion-ready funnel**
  - Deliverable: Single-offer funnel with form, CTA, and thank-you sequencing.
  - Evidence: Screenshots of builder layout, form settings, live page, and a test submission trail in Contacts/Workflows.
  - Rubric: Pass if form + CTA function, consent is captured, and the thank-you page presents clear next steps.
