# Module 09 — Marketing (Email, Campaigns, Templates, Trigger Links, Ad Manager entry)

🔗 **Appendix:** [Plain Language + Glossary (A–Z with screenshots)](Appendix_Plain_Language_Glossary.md) — includes navigation verbs quick-reference (EN/ES/PH).

## Why it matters
Marketing is how you produce outbound sequences and assets that are measurable and consistent. For capstone: email templates, campaign-style outreach, trigger links to landing pages/PDF, and (optionally) Ad Manager integration.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Create and manage email templates.
- Use campaigns appropriately (when vs workflows).
- Use trigger links to track clicks and trigger automations.
- Understand Social Planner and Ad Manager at a “navigation + setup” level.

## Vocabulary
- **Email template**: reusable email content
  - *What this means:* Draft the message once and reuse it across campaigns or workflows with merge fields.
- **Campaign**: scheduled/batched marketing sends (use-case dependent)
  - *What this means:* Use campaigns for planned blasts instead of event-driven automation.
- **Trigger link**: tracked link that can trigger workflow actions when clicked
  - *What this means:* Swap ordinary URLs for trigger links so clicks show on the contact timeline and fire automations.
- **Ad Manager**: ad management workspace (if used)
  - *What this means:* This area centralizes ad accounts and reporting when connected.
- **UTM parameters**: tracking tags added to URLs for attribution
  - *What this means:* Add UTMs to see which channel or campaign produced the click or conversion.

## Production SOP — Trigger link usage
- Use trigger links for:
  - click tracking
  - moving pipeline stages (“proposal viewed”)
  - starting payment follow-ups
- Always test:
  - link resolves to correct URL
  - click registers on contact timeline
  - workflow trigger fires as intended

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) Trigger links do: **track clicks and can trigger workflow actions** ✅  
2) True/False: A trigger link click can be used as a workflow trigger. **True** ✅  
3) Email templates help by: **standardizing brand voice and saving time** ✅  
4) UTM parameters help with: **attribution tracking** ✅  
5) Trigger links can be used in: **email, SMS, and supported social channels** ✅  
6) Marketing assets should be tested by: **sending to a test contact** ✅  
7) Social Planner is used for: **scheduling social posts** ✅  
8) Ad Manager matters for: **ad reporting + campaign management (if enabled)** ✅  
9) Workflows are best for: **behavior-driven automation** ✅  
10) Campaigns are best for: **broadcast/batch marketing (use-case dependent)** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
**Goal:** Social post + email template for Ace Web Agency.
1) Social Planner: Connect a social account if possible (or use draft mode). Create a scheduled post for tomorrow with caption like “Hello from Ace Web Agency! 🚀 …” and optional image. Screenshot the Social Planner calendar/list showing the scheduled post.
2) Email template: Marketing → Emails/Templates → create `Welcome Email` using the builder; include greeting, brief services blurb, and CTA. Screenshot the template preview/editor.
3) Quick reflection: In one sentence list at least two marketing features you would use for lead generation (e.g., Social Planner, Email Campaigns, Funnel builder, Ads integration).
Evidence: Social post scheduled view, email template preview, and the feature list sentence. Rubric: Pass if a scheduled/drafted post is visible, the email template has real content, and the feature list mentions at least two correct tools.

## Relatable metaphor — “Broadcast Studio with Switchboard”
Marketing is a studio with mics, cameras, and a switchboard. You pick the channel, queue the segment, and watch the meters to avoid dead air or feedback.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **List warm-up**
  - Decision: send SMS or email first? → Use email to warm, SMS only to consented contacts with quiet hours set.
  - Decision: which link to track? → Use trigger links for each offer variant to segment responders.
- **Ad hoc promo request**
  - Decision: use campaign or workflow? → Use campaign for broadcast batch, workflow for behavior-driven sequences.
  - Decision: low open rates? → Test subject line variation, resend to non-openers, and check domain reputation.
