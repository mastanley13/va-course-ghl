# Module 12 — Memberships & Communities (Optional/Advanced)

🔗 **Appendix:** [Plain Language + Glossary (A–Z with screenshots)](Appendix_Plain_Language_Glossary.md) — includes navigation verbs quick-reference (EN/ES/PH).

## Why it matters
Memberships/Communities are optional for the capstone, but they are common in client builds. They matter when the advertiser offer includes training, onboarding, or a partner portal.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Create a course structure (categories + lessons).
- Create offers for access (free/paid).
- Invite members and troubleshoot login access.
- Configure a community group and attach learning content.

## Vocabulary
- **Course**: structured content
- **Lesson**: unit inside a course
- **Offer**: access + pricing wrapper for a course
- **Member**: user with login access
- **Community group**: discussion + learning space

4) Members access content via: **login portal** ✅

6) True/False: Deleting a course is always safe. **False** ✅  
7) A community group can: **include learning content** ✅  
8) Best practice for onboarding: **welcome email + clear next steps** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
**Goal:** Create a sample course/offer (and optional community) for Ace Web Agency.
1) Course: Sites → Memberships → Products → Create Product `Web Design Basics Course`; add at least one lesson (e.g., Welcome) with text or a video link; publish the lesson. Screenshot the course/lesson list.
2) Offer: Memberships → Offers → New Offer `Web Design Basics (Free)` (or set a price) and attach the course. Screenshot the offer detail showing the attached product/price.
3) Community (optional if available): Create `Web Agency Students` community and add a welcome post. Screenshot the community view.
4) Member preview: Copy the offer signup link, open it in an incognito tab, and preview the student view of the course. Screenshot the learner view if possible.
5) Reflection: List two use-cases for Memberships in GHL (e.g., selling courses, client onboarding portal, community hub).
Evidence: Course/lesson screenshot, offer screenshot, optional community/post, and the use-case note. Rubric: Pass if the course and offer exist with a published lesson and the use-case list is provided.

## Relatable metaphor — “Private Clubhouse”
Memberships and Communities are the clubhouse: members get keys, see curated rooms, and follow house rules to keep the vibe strong.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **Onboarding new members**
  - Decision: auto-enroll or manual? → Auto-enroll after payment; manual for scholarship/partner access.
  - Decision: welcome via email or SMS? → Use email for links and policy, SMS only if consented for reminders.
- **Moderating community posts**
  - Decision: delete or coach? → Hide harmful content, but coach members on formatting and tagging to keep engagement organized.
  - Decision: who can post announcements? → Limit to moderators/admins to avoid noise.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. When do you grant access to a course? <details><summary>Answer</summary>After payment/qualification, via offer access settings.</details>
2. How do you reduce churn inside the community? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Post weekly prompts, pin guidelines, and respond quickly to new member posts.</details>
3. Which channel is best for delivering login links? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Email, so members can click and save credentials.</details>
4. What tag could you add to community-only members? <details><summary>Answer</summary>`seg:community-only` to separate from paying students.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Course + offer preview**
  - Deliverable: Published sample course with offer (free or paid) and optional community welcome post.
  - Evidence: Course/lesson list, offer attachment screenshot, community screenshot (if created), and learner preview if possible.
  - Rubric: Pass if the course is published with an offer attached and the member experience is demonstrated or explained.
