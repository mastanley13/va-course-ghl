# Module 15 — Reporting (Dashboards + Custom Reports + Attribution)

🔗 **Appendix:** [Plain Language + Glossary (A–Z with screenshots)](Appendix_Plain_Language_Glossary.md) — includes navigation verbs quick-reference (EN/ES/PH).

## Why it matters
Reporting proves the system works and tells you where to improve. For capstone, reporting must answer:
- Are we generating new advertiser leads?
- Which channels convert?
- How long does it take to go from lead → paid?
- What’s the fulfillment throughput?

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Explain attribution at a high level (first vs latest).
- Build a dashboard for weekly KPIs.
- Convert dashboards into custom reports (or build a report from scratch).
- Identify common reporting discrepancies (timezone, opportunity value vs payment totals).

## Vocabulary
- **Attribution**: source/channel that generated lead
- **First vs latest attribution**: original source vs most recent source
- **Dashboard**: KPI view
- **Custom report**: scheduled/shareable report output
- **KPI**: measurable metric (leads, bookings, won deals, revenue)

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) Attribution answers: **where leads came from** ✅  
2) First attribution is: **first interaction source** ✅  
3) Latest attribution is: **most recent interaction source** ✅  
4) Custom reports can be created by: **starting from scratch or converting a dashboard** ✅  
5) A KPI dashboard should include: **leads, booked, won, revenue (as defined)** ✅  
6) Revenue mismatch can occur because: **opportunity value vs payments collected** ✅  
7) Timezone mismatch can cause: **date shifts in reporting** ✅  
8) Reports should be: **scheduled weekly/monthly for client communication** ✅  
9) Reporting helps: **optimize workflows and outreach** ✅  
10) A strong report is: **actionable, not just numbers** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
**Goal:** Navigate and interpret at least one report.
1) Open Reporting: Choose one subsection (e.g., Funnel/Site Analytics for your landing page, Appointment Report, or Pipeline Performance).
2) Apply a filter or date range change to see how the view updates (even if data is sparse).
3) Capture one insight: e.g., “1 appointment booked in last 7 days” or “2 visits / 1 conversion = 50% on the funnel.”
4) Optional: Note which report you’d use to assess sales team performance (e.g., Agent Report/Pipeline).
Evidence: Screenshot of the Reporting screen you viewed (graph/table visible) and a short written insight. Rubric: Pass if a report view is shown and an insight is articulated, even with test data.

## Relatable metaphor — “Flight Instruments”
Reporting is the cockpit instrument panel. It tells you altitude, speed, and heading so you can correct course before turbulence becomes a crisis.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **Revenue dip detected**
  - Decision: attribution or actual? → Compare Payments vs Opportunities; if mismatch, inspect source/UTM and timezone settings.
  - Decision: which module next? → Drill into Opportunities stages for drop-off points.
- **Channel performance review**
  - Decision: which filters to apply? → Filter by campaign/source tags and date ranges aligned to spend periods.
  - Decision: share or export? → Share dashboard links internally; export CSV only when needed for finance.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. What do you check if appointments drop but traffic is steady? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Calendar availability/reminders and form submission-to-booking conversion.</details>
2. How do you avoid skewed revenue reports? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Separate opportunity value from collected payments and align timezones.</details>
3. When should you export data? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Only when necessary for finance/audits; prefer in-platform sharing otherwise.</details>
4. Which tags help with source-level reporting? <details><summary>Answer</summary>`src:` and `utm_` fields on contacts/opportunities.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Report exploration**
  - Deliverable: One reporting view explored with a meaningful observation.
  - Evidence: Reporting screenshot (chart/table) and a written insight; optional note on which report measures sales team performance.
  - Rubric: Pass if a valid report screen is captured and the observation aligns with the view shown.
