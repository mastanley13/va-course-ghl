# Module 13 — Media Storage (Assets)

🔗 **Appendix:** [Plain Language + Glossary (A–Z with screenshots)](Appendix_Plain_Language_Glossary.md) — includes navigation verbs quick-reference (EN/ES/PH).

## Why it matters
Media Storage is the asset source for Sites, Email, Social, and Products. Clean asset management prevents broken branding and duplicated clutter.

## Learning outcomes
A passing VA can:
- Create a folder structure for a new client build.
- Upload and organize media with consistent naming.
- Use bulk actions (move/delete) safely.
- Restore from trash and understand retention.
- Edit an image using the built-in editor (basic crop/adjustments).

## Vocabulary
- **Media library**: asset storage
- **Folder hierarchy**: organization structure
- **Trash**: deleted item holding area (time-limited)
- **Preview/insert**: selecting assets inside builders
- **Duplicate control**: avoiding repeated uploads

## Recommended folder structure
- `01 Brand Kit`
- `02 Website`
- `03 Funnels`
- `04 Social`
- `05 Documents`
- `99 Archive`

## Quiz (sample bank)
1) Media Storage is used by: **Sites/Email/Social/Products** ✅  
2) True/False: Deleting an item always permanently removes it immediately. **False** ✅  
3) Why avoid duplicates? **Confusion + wrong assets used + clutter** ✅  
4) File limits can: **vary by product/module** ✅  
5) Built-in editor can do: **crop/rotate/basic adjustments** ✅  
6) A consistent folder system helps: **repeatable builds** ✅  
7) Safe deletion means: **use trash/restore when needed** ✅  
8) A “brand kit” should contain: **logos, icons, core images** ✅

## Lab assignment (evidence required)
**Goal:** Upload and share a file via Media Library.
1) Open Media: Marketing/Settings → Media Library.
2) Upload at least one sample file (image or PDF). Rename it with a clean, consistent filename (e.g., `ace-web-pricing.pdf`).
3) Copy the public/share link for the file.
4) Optional: Use the file in an email template or funnel (link or image insert).
Evidence: Screenshot of the Media Library with the uploaded file visible, plus the copied link pasted in your submission (or shown in the screenshot). Optional extra screenshot if you inserted it in an email/page. Rubric: Pass if a file is uploaded, named cleanly, and the share link is captured.

## Relatable metaphor — “Warehouse Shelving”
Media Storage is the warehouse shelving system. If every box is labeled and shelved, pickers (workflows/pages) can grab assets fast; if not, orders get delayed.

## Scenario walkthroughs with decision points
- **New campaign assets arriving**
  - Decision: where to place? → Use department folders (ACQ/RET) and subfolders by offer; apply naming convention immediately.
  - Decision: versioning? → Append `v1`, `v2` in filenames and archive old versions in an `Archive` folder.
- **Missing asset link on a live page**
  - Decision: broken link or permissions? → Test the asset URL; if 404, re-upload and update references; if permission issue, adjust sharing or re-link via built-in library.

## Stop and try (self-check)
1. Why avoid spaces in filenames? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Prevents URL encoding issues and makes links predictable.</details>
2. Which folder naming keeps assets discoverable? <details><summary>Answer</summary>`[DEPT]/[Offer]/[Type]` such as `ACQ/Advertiser Offer/Hero Images`.</details>
3. How do you confirm a link works on a page? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Open the link in an incognito tab and refresh the page using it.</details>
4. When should you archive vs delete? <details><summary>Answer</summary>Archive old versions to retain history unless there is a compliance reason to delete.</details>

## Practice labs + evidence rubric
- **Lab: Media upload + link**
  - Deliverable: Uploaded asset with clean filename and share URL (optionally placed in an email/page).
  - Evidence: Media Library screenshot and copied URL; optional screenshot where the asset is used.
  - Rubric: Pass if the asset is visible, named cleanly, and the link is captured.
